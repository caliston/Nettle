This file needs some structure... ;-)

Dmenu widths

Wimp slot size settable for new tasks?

* ANSI commandline task shell for ANSI task window (ROSH)
* Scroll to bottom on keypress and/or output
* VT 320/420/510
* SSH

We don't support double width/height fonts at all.

vttest can be found (at the time of writing) at http://dickey.his.com/vttest/vttest.html

Implement tests: known broken/unimplemented vttests (version 20030301) are:
        3:7, 3:8, 3:9, 3:10
	4
 	5:2, 5:4, 5:5, 5:7, 5:8
	6:1, 6:5, 6:6, 6:7
	7
	11:1:2:1, 11:1:2:3, 11:1:2:4
	11:1:4, 11:1:5, 11:1:8
	11:2:1:1, 11:2:1:2
	11:2:3:1, 11:2:3:4
	11:2:4 ?, 11:2:8
	11:2:9
	11:2:10 except 11:2:10:1:2
	11:2:11
	11:3:2, 11:3:6 ?, 11:3:7 ?
	11:4:7
	11:6:2:3, 11:6:2:4, 11:6:2:5, 11:6:2:6
	11:6:3, 11:6:4, 11:6:5, 11:6:6
	
Where the sequence above does not uniquely identify an entry, it means all of the sub-entries
are broken in someway.

Source files need more comments

Bugs:

* Terminal emulation incomplete - esoteric vt commands unimplemented
* ANSI task cannot be used as a "regular" taskwindow.
  - It never will, because it interprets codes as ANSI - that's its
    whole point in life.  This will be improved by "ROSH"
