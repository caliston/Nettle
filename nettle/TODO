New design hotlist code - the menu's still crap - will work on that on Sunday
An example hotlist file (Choices:Nettle.Hotlist) would be:
---
# Nettle Hotlist, saved on some day

Nice Host
{
  host: 192.168.1.1
  port: 23
  type: telnet
  term: vt220
  wide: 80
  high: 24
  scrl: 5000
}

BASIC
{
  type: taskwindow
  cmnd: BASIC
}
----


Implement tests.
Implement Selective Erase (it only erases characters marked as erasable)
Implement insert characters.
Implement delete line.
Implement insert line.
Implement selective erasable.

Make it check for open sessions on quitting - ie. ask for confirmation

Mouse events - need to prod pico -m  a bit, and find out how mouse events are done.

Dynamic window resizing

Source files need more comments

Choices!
c.socket            	- needs finished (not needed for Nettle, but should be done sometime)
