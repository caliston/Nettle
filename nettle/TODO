This file needs some structure... ;-)

Spooling (logging? generic?)

Drag binary to ANSI Task open dialog command line

Sort tab order in hotlist dialog

menu widths
 
RO 3.1 bits (C icons, titlebar redraw...)

Always use 3D templates

Wimp slot size settable for new tasks?

* Much faster terminal scrollback handling
* Reordering of hotlist items within hotlist editor
* More choices: F12 handling, blinking cursor...
* Use global clipboard
* Load data from dragged files
* ANSI commandline task shell for ANSI task window (ROSH)
* Dynamic resize of terminal
* Scroll to bottom on keypress
* VT 320/420/510
* SSH

Implement tests.
Implement Selective Erase (it only erases characters marked as erasable)
Implement insert characters.
Implement delete line.
Implement insert line.
Implement selective erasable.

Make it check for open sessions on quitting - ie. ask for confirmation

Mouse events - need to prod pico -m  a bit, and find out how mouse events are done.

Dynamic window resizing

Source files need more comments

Choices!
c.socket            	- needs finished (not needed for Nettle, but should be done sometime)


Bugs:

* Terminal emulation incomplete - esoteric vt commands unimplemented
* ANSI task cannot be used as a "regular" taskwindow.
  - It never will, because it interprets codes as ANSI - that's its
    whole point in life.  This will be improved by "ROSH"
* Doesn't abort desktop shutdown when connections are active



An example hotlist file (Choices:Nettle.Hotlist) would be:

# Nettle Hotlist, saved on some day
