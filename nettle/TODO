This file needs some structure... ;-)

Grey-out buttons on hotlist list editor when unavailable for clicking

// * Much faster terminal scrollback handling
* Reordering of hotlist items within hotlist editor
* More choices: F12 handling, blinking cursor...
* Use global clipboard
* Load data from dragged files
* ANSI commandline task shell for ANSI task window (ROSH)
* Dynamic resize of terminal
* Scroll to bottom on keypress
* VT 320/420/510
* SSH

Bugs:

* Terminal emulation incomplete - esoteric vt commands unimplemented
* ANSI task cannot be used as a "regular" taskwindow.
  - It never will, because it interprets codes as ANSI - that's its
    whole point in life.  This will be improved by "ROSH"
* Doesn't abort desktop shutdown when connections are active
