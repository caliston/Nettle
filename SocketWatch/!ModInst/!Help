!Help for !ModInst V0.04
========================

This program will relatively intelligently install modules into the
!System directory, and can also install a MimeMap file into the
appropriate place if required.

When installing modules, it won't overwrite a module in !System that
is newer than the one it was asked to install.


This program is distributed under the GPL.
Note that the contents of the Resources directory have their own
